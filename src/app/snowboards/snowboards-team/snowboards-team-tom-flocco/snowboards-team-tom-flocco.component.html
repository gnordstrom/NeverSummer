						<div><strong style="font-family: Helvetica;">MEET TOM...&nbsp;</strong><span>I love to snowboard and I can't seem to ever stop. So I may as well push it as hard as my old beat up meat popsicle can handle. NS boards kick so much     ass! Big thanks to Cooper Hoffmeister for getting me started with this company. Also thanks to Jason Hindman for getting on the mountain with me all     winter every winter.</span>
